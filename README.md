**Why am I doing all this**

I am quite happy with my life except one thing, I have 48% win rate in World of Tanks. And we all know how we call people with 48% win rate in the life. I believe I found the reason for my poor results (and it's not the lack of my skills) - when I play the game and I get my tank close to a building, or between two buildings (that's evern worse) the camera acts crazy. Instead of just making buildings transparent, it tries to force a rule 'nothing between me and the tank' so it starts zooming in. The unexpected zooming just makes it impossible to focus on the situation and aim at the enemies, instead I am sitting there looking for a proper angle for my camera. That's very frustrating.

So here I am, learning how to create game engines so I can get a job in WG to finally fix that camera. How hard can it be to make everything just transparent! Hopefully that will let me get from 48% to 49%, and that just brings everything into your life: fame, money, girls, respect.
