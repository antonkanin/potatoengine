- add memory clean up to video, physics, audio

- add different geometry types: cube, sphere, line

Done
- separate IMGUI integration into input handling and rendering
- refactor engine_sdl using strategy pattern (abstract classes: rendering_strategy,
  input_strategy, audio_strategy, etc)
- separate logic into 4 separate components:
    * input
    * rendering
    * audio
    * physics
- separate light and other objects rendering
- add basic lighting
- read apply diffuse color to the vertex when it's present in the model
- add support for multiple game objects with models, currently we only support one mesh
- enhance shader class: add a method to setup uniforms
- add movable_object class and make it available to the game_object
- add delta time to the engine and let objects use it
- read UV coordinates
